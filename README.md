# Forecasting Ice Cream Sales

üç¶ The goal of this project is to predict future ice cream sales for a small ice cream shop using time series forecasting and the XGBoost machine learning algorithm.

üìä **Data**: The data for this project will consist of historical ice cream sales data for the past several years, including information such as the date, units of ice cream sold, and dollar sales.

üîé **Methodology**: The data will be cleaned and preprocessed to prepare for modelling. Next, a time series model will be built using the XGBoost algorithm to predict ice cream sales. The model will be trained on a portion of the data, and then tested on the remaining data to evaluate its performance.

üí≠ **Expected Results**: It is expected that the XGBoost model will be able to closely predict ice cream sales and units for the small ice cream shop. The model's performance will be evaluated using cross validation and various metrics, such as mean absolute error and root mean squared error.

‚≠ê **Conclusion**: By accurately predicting ice cream sales, the small ice cream shop will be able to better manage inventory needs, leading to increased efficiency and profits. This project demonstrates the effectiveness of using time series forecasting and the XGBoost algorithm for this type of business application.
